\section sec_overview Overview

This is a ROS package, developped for ROS Groovy.

This package was created with the purpose of providing a table-detection
tool for robotic manipulation, or any other purpose. Most of the existing
table-detection tools only detects plane. We wanted a tool that could give
us dimensions of the table. We also needed to give the system some indications
about that table, so that it can 'choose' between several possibilities. These
indications are the normal of the plane, a bounding box were the plane table is 
expected to be, or at least a height range (for standard table we will be looking
for a plane that is normal to the vertical, and in the range 70 - 90 cm)

This package provides a tool for seeking for a plane that is orthogonal to the 'z' axis
of a provided tf frame. It also provides an implementation of the filtering process (from pcl tutorial).
Contains an helpfull launcher, for demo.

\section sec_nodes Nodes
Here is a list of the nodes of the package and their parameters, published and subscribed topics, services, etc...

\subsection sec_node_detection Node ransac_plane_detection
Defined here: ransac_plane_detection.h.

The node that actually does the computation. It uses RanSAC methods for detecting the plane and its borders.

\subsubsection sec_detection_param Parameters
\em reference_tf (string, default: "/world")\n
The name of the reference frame. The program will seek for a plane that is orthogonal to the z axis of this frame.

\em ransac_dist_threshold (float, default: 0.01)\n
for pcl ransac method.

\em ransac_model_espilon (float, default: 0.05)\n
For pcl ransac method, the epsilon angle offset for plane matching.

\em ortho_rad_thresh (float, default: 0.08)\n
The angle threshold that will be used to determine if an angle is ~pi/2 (90Â°).

\em publish_plane_pcl (boolean, default: false)\n
Choose to publish the point cloud of the detected table (inliers).

\em publish_hull_pcl (boolean, default: false)\n
Deprecated: only usefull for debug, should be removed.
Choose to publish the detected hull (for debug).

\em publish_marker_rviz (boolean, default: false)\n
Choose to publish a rviz marker to visualize detection results in rviz.


\em max_height (float, default: 0.9)\n
The maximal height of the table we search.

\em min_height (float, default: 0.65)\n
The minimal height of the table we search.

\subsubsection sec_detection_sub_topics Subscribed topics
\em ~input (sensor_msgs/PointCloud2)\n
Input pointcloud, organized or not (can be filtered)

\subsubsection sec_detection_pub_topics Published topics
\em ~output (sensor_msgs/PointCloud2)\n
Pointcloud of inliers (the pointcloud of the plane)

\subsubsection sec_detection_tf Published transform
/camera_depth_optical_frame -> /plane\n
The transform from the camera to the estimated center of the plane
