rectangular_table_detection

This package provides a tool for seeking for a plane that is orthogonal to the 'z' axis
of a provided tf frame. It also provides an implementation of the filtering process (from pcl tutorial)
Contains an helpfull launcher, for demo

node ransac_plane_detection
parameters
	reference_tf : the name of the tf frame to use. The program will seek for a plane that is orthogonal to the z axis of this frame
		default = "/world", for tables, floor...
	ransac_dist_threshold : for pcl ransac method, default = 0.01
	ransac_model_espilon : for pcl ransac method, the epsilon angle offset for plane matching

topics
	~input : input pointcloud
	~output : pointcloud of inliers (the pointcloud of the plane)

published transform
	/camera_depth_optical_frame -> /plane : the transform from the camera to the estimated center of the plane

node simple_filtering
	directly from ros pcl tutorial http://www.ros.org/wiki/pcl/Tutorials
